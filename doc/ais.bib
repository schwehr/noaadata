   Abstract = {Commercial shipping is increasing in the U.S. and worldwide, with increased numbers and speed of cargo vessels. In addition to increased cargo vessel traffic, harbors and coastal areas will also be transited by newly expanding fleets of both high speed ferries and liquid natural gas carriers. In addition to fishing vessel activities, these increases in maritime vessel traffic pose an enhanced risk of whale strikes by vessels, endangering both whales and humans on the ships. We first review specifics detailing the scope of the problem: the frequency and distribution of whale ship strike incidents in U.S. coastal areas, including Alaska and Hawaii. Next we review recent developments that make possible a reduction in whale ship strikes through real-time distribution of whale position data determined from multiple moored buoys equipped with marine mammal detecting hydrophones that have communications links to shore. This system has been implemented for the shipping lane approaches to the harbor of Boston, Massachusetts where ship traffic transits areas of the Stellwegen Bank National Marine Sanctuary frequently used by whales. From the mooring-derived data whale position information is estimated and transmitted to vessels in real time via required ship Automated Identification Systems (AIS) with the goal of reducing the incidence of whale ship strikes. In the future, use of newly available inexpensive autonomous unmanned surface vessels (USVs) equipped with hydrophones can provide similar information on whale positions over a much more spatially extensive area than is possible with fixed moorings. USVs can be directed by human observers or automated to follow whales at a certain range to continuously monitor animal positions during migrations, and provide a measure of protection throughout their habitat. Through the use of multiple USVs whale positions can be accurately determined via triangulation, and the potential exists to monitor whale behavior in response to ship traffic or bathymetric features, as well as to document interactions among whales. We describe how the use of new low cost USVs can be combined with new wave energy harvesting technologies to provide power for extended periods of USV propulsion, as well as for underwater hydrophone or other sensors, and to power communications with shore-based signal processing and AIS communication centers. Examples are given for ship interactions with Humpback Whales and endangered North Atlantic Right Whales on the east coast, and North Pacific Right Whales, Humpback Whales, Blue Whales and Beluga Whales in west coast and Hawaiian waters. Adoption of the new low cost technologies discussed would minimize whale ship strikes in the future. Moreover, the methods proposed would not only reduce loss of life, but be highly cost-effective since they would reduce costs of maritime rescue and investigation efforts, avoid expensive ship repairs and schedule delays, and minimize costly closures of commercial fisheries for protection of endangered whale species. In addition to these cost savings for maritime operations, the methods proposed would provide improved protection for whales, including several critically endangered species.},

   BookTitle = {NAV07},
   Publisher = {Royal Institute of Navigation},
   Abstract = {The Automatic Identification System (AIS) has to date primarily been applied in the  provision of Vessel Traffic Services in a basic  manner.  AIS has been very valuable in  assisting VTS in identification of radar targets  and tracking of vessels in non-radar coverage  areas.  In some instances it has reduced voice  communications by replacing previously  required position reporting.  However, the full  benefit of AIS capability to VTS beyond these  basic applications has yet to be realized.  

 AIS has the capability to revolutionize  VTS operations and provide vast benefit to the  mariner in the form of properly presented  information at the right time.  However, there  are many issues which need to be examined  and resolved in order to fully realize this  capability.   

This paper will examine the current state  of AIS usage in Vessel Traffic Services  (primarily in the United States), review some  existing innovative uses of AIS for VTS  purposes and attempt to illuminate the  potential for future use of AIS in VTS.  Along  with future potential uses, issues that VTS  authorities should take into consideration will  be identified.  While recognizing that AIS is  not a panacea, the future use of AIS will be  information-driven:  making information  available for the mariner and other users and  getting it to and from places that were not  possible, not feasible and likely not even  thought of in the past.},

   BookTitle = {AGU Fall 2007},

   Publisher = {AGU},
   Abstract = {The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a new technology that provides ship position reports with location, time, and identity information without human intervention from ships carrying the transponders to any receiver listening to the broadcasts.  In collaboration with the USCG's Research and Development Center, NOAA's Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (SBNMS) has installed 3 AIS receivers around Massachusetts Bay to monitor ship traffic transiting the sanctuary and surrounding waters.  The SBNMS and the USCG also worked together propose the shifting the shipping lanes (termed the traffic separation scheme; TSS) that transit the sanctuary slightly to the north to reduce the probability of ship strikes of whales that frequent the sanctuary.  Following approval by the United Nation's International Maritime Organization, AIS provided a means for NOAA to assess changes in the distribution of shipping traffic caused by formal change in the TSS effective July 1, 2007.  However, there was no easy way to visualize this type of time series data.

We have created a software package called noaadata-py to process the AIS ship reports and produce KML files for viewing in Google Earth.  Ship tracks can be shown changing over time to allow the viewer to feel the motion of traffic through the sanctuary.  The ship tracks can also be gridded to create ship traffic density reports for specified periods of time.  The density is displayed as map draped on the sea surface or as vertical histogram columns.  Additional visualizations such as bathymetry images, S57 nautical charts, and USCG Marine Information for Safety and Law Enforcement (MISLE) can be combined with the ship traffic visualizations to give a more complete picture of the maritime environment.

AIS traffic analyses have the potential to give managers throughout NOAA's National Marine Sanctuaries an improved ability to assess the impacts of ship traffic on the marine resources they seek to protect.  Viewing ship traffic data through Google Earth provides ease and efficiency for people not trained in GIS data processing.},

Virtual globe software provides a gateway to a host of important data products in formats usable by specialized tools such as CARIS, Fledermaus, and Arc/Info.

The USCG Marine Information for Safety and Law Enforcement (MISLE) database of ship incidents illustrates point data.  A short sample of the USCG National Automatic Identification System logs (N-AIS) demonstrates rendering of line data.  Area data is exemplified in the United Nations Convention f the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) multibeam bathymetry.  Point, line and area data are combined to present a preview of S57 chart information.  Finally, the MISLE database uses time to show maritime incidents that occurred in US waterways. 
The visualizations for our initial work were created with hand coding and small scripts.  However, tools such as Fledermaus and RockWare have added Google Earth export functionality that makes authoring Google Earth resources easy to construct. For large dataset that require additional processing and analyses, Google Earth visualizations can offer users a range of download formats and suggest what software to use.

   Title = {Air vessel tracking system and method},
   Abstract = {1. Field of the Invention

This invention relates generally to methods for detecting and reporting the state of a vessel during travel. An embodiment of the invention may be used detect and report the in-flight state of an air vessel.

2. Description of Related Art 

Many systems have been developed for sensing and reporting vehicle or vessel traffic. These systems may incorporate data from one or more sensors to track and/or report a condition of a vessel. One example of a marine vessel tracking system is a system that uses reports transmitted from marine vessels to a tracking center to follow marine traffic, described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,658,349 to Cline, which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. Another example of such a system was developed as a government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) vessel tracking system for the U.S. Coast Guard by the Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) at Paxutent River, Maryland. This system is generally known as the Coast Guard Vessel Traffic System (CGVTS). U.S. Pat. No. 6,249,241 to Jordan et al., which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, describes the CGVTS as an improved radar harbor surveillance sensor, computer, and display system that monitors marine harbor traffic, provides advisories to vessels in areas selected by system operators, and provides the operators of the system with early warning of unacceptable traffic conflicts in a harbor. 

he CGVTS replaced radar plan position indicator (PPI) displays with commercial computer systems able to present radar images and tracks overlaid on electronic charts. The CGVTS may be integrated with a set of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras and/or voice radio communication interfaces to provide a more complete vessel traffic management system. The CGVTS system was installed successfully in the ports of New York, Puget Sound, and San Francisco harbors between 1993 and 1995.

The original CGVTS system was designed to run on a UNIX operating system. Following introduction of the original CGVTS, code for operating the CGVTS has been ported to Microsoft Windows.RTM. operating systems (e.g., Windows.RTM. NT and Windows.RTM. 2000). The CGVTS may be operated on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) systems on the Microsoft Windows.RTM. operating system.

The system has been updated, refined, and renamed SureTrak by NAWCAD. Current versions of the SureTrak vessel tracking system include several functional components (e.g., sensors, data analysis components, tracking components). The SureTrak vessel tracking system includes a system architecture that allows functional components to operate on separate processors or allows functional components to be co-located on a single processor. Such a system architecture allows the vessel tracking system to be flexible in size and allows for integration of new or updated functional components more easily. 

SUMMARY

In an embodiment, a vessel tracking system may be used to detect and report an alert condition of a vessel (e.g., an aircraft). The vessel tracking system may monitor one or more travel characteristics (e.g., flight characteristics) of the vessel. At least one of the travel characteristics may be compared to one or more normal travel characteristics to assess (e.g., determine) an alert condition of the vessel. In some embodiments, the alert condition of the vessel may be reported (e.g., visually reported on a display). An alert condition of the vessel may include an alert level for the vessel that corresponds to a danger level or threat level for the vessel based on the vessel's travel characteristics.

In certain embodiments, a vessel tracking system may assess (e.g., determine) a dynamic state of a vessel from one or more travel characteristics of the vessel. The dynamic state of the vessel may be compared to a normal dynamic state for the vessel. If at least one travel characteristic of the dynamic state of the vessel deviates from a predetermined value of at least one normal travel characteristic of the normal dynamic state, a boundary condition of an alert for the vessel may be modified (e.g., increased). An alert for the vessel may include, but is not limited to, a proximity alert, a boundary alert, and/or an exclusive area alert. An alarm may be provided when at least one boundary condition of the alert is crossed.

In some embodiments, one or more normal travel characteristics of a vessel may be modified based on a flight phase of the vessel. A flight phase of the vessel may include, but is not limited to, takeoff, enroute, approach, and landing. In certain embodiments, one or more of the travel characteristics of a vessel may be modified if at least one travel characteristic of the vessel deviates from a predetermined value of at least one normal travel characteristic of the vessel.},

   Abstract = {Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a system for ship identification and tracking, that has  the capability of both transmitting and receiving information. AIS can be considered as one of  the most significant technical tools developed since the invention of radar. However, its  information exchange capacity is limited and IMO administers the content of the AIS  messages to avoid overloading of the AIS frequencies. Various stakeholders have proposed  additional needs to the present content of the AIS information and IMO shall in 2008 next  open the discussion on the amendments to AIS operation.  

The international community and the maritime safety, security and environmental authorities  as the executing party have a responsibility to undertake the monitoring of vessel traffic and  to ensure the sufficient distribution of information to vessel traffic. By fulfilling their  responsibilities, the authorities enhance the safety and efficiency of maritime traffic and  contribute to the protection of marine environment. In addition to the responsibilities  numerous services need to be provided. These activities are in many respects based on the  information available to the authority. AIS is one of the most significant information sources  available. While emphasising the need for information, the work load caused to vessels as  well as authorities by different reporting requirements should always be considered.   IMO gave in its circular (SN/Circ. 236) a possibility for the application of seven predefined  binary messages. However, before the implementation the usability of these messages  should be tested in full scale tests (ship-to-shore) and the information content and usability  evaluated. At the same time it is a favourable moment to evaluate the content of other AIS  messages to ensure that the messages reflect the needs of information users.    

VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Finnish Maritime Administration, The Finnish  Environment Institute (SYKE), Finnish Coast Guard, Estonian Maritime Administration and  Swedish Maritime Administartion have launched a study focusing on the above described  issues. The Baltic AIS trial project aims to enhance the quality of information exchanged  between vessel traffic and authorities by testing the operational and technical usability of  binary messages, evaluating the information content of different messages and proposing  revisions on present messages, based upon the observations and conclusions made during  the project.},

   Abstract = {The size and draft of ships calling on United States ports has steadily grown over the past 50 years.  Today's vessels may be transiting into port with as little as 0.3 meters (one foot) beneath their keel.  This increase in the size of the vessel has caused the mariner to ask questions of the chart and its data that the tradition products, both paper and electronic versions, are incapable of answering.  An operational solution to this problem may be constructed using existing technologies.  High resolution bathymetry and their associated uncertainties provide the foundation for using algorithmic cartography to render the data in new, more intuitive ways.  When this high resolution bathymetric foundation is combined with real-time water levels, telemetered to the underway vessel via the Automatic Identification System (AIS), it is possible to create an electronic navigational chart which is capable of displaying a “tide-aware” ship's safe contour to the mariner.  Since both the bathymetry and the water level interpolation method have a computed uncertainty value, an expressed uncertainty of the charted display may also be presented.  

This paper describes an operational model for how this may achieved and discusses results from initial field trials.  In particular, tidal information is provided in XML format and relayed via AIS to all vessels underway within radio range of the shoreside AIS transmitter.  Once this data is received aboard the vessel, it is utilized by a software engine developed in Coast Survey's Hydrographic Systems and Technology Program (HSTP) which computes a water surface model based on the Tidal Constituent and Residual Interpolation (TCARI) method.  This water surface model is then provided to navigation software also developed in HSTP called ECS++ (for Electronic Chart System with enhancements).  This software then combines the high resolution bathymetry with the water surface to arrive at a bathymetric model with values representative of the actual water depths.  This model is in turn displayed in the ECS++ display window to show the available water within the navigational theater, based on modeled water levels.   Using this methodology, ECS++ is capable of estimating the water level at a vessel's position for any location and instance in time.},

   Abstract = {The concept of River Information Services (RIS) has emerged from several European research projects, aiming at increasing safety and efficiency of inland waterway transport.

The European Commission, the CCNR and the Danube Commission have recognized the need for means of automatic exchange of navigational data between ships and between ship and shore for automatic identification and tracking and tracing solutions in inland navigation.

In maritime navigation, IMO has introduced the Automatic Identification System (AIS). All seagoing vessels on international voyage falling under SOLAS convention Chapter 5 have to be equipped with AIS since the end of 2004. The Guidelines and Recommendations for River Information Services (RIS Guidelines 2004) of PIANC and CCNR define Inland-AIS as important technology.

The European RIS Platform established in 2003 the expert group for tracking and tracing. The main task of this expert group is the development and maintenance of a European wide harmonised vessel tracking and tracing standard for inland navigation. Because of mixed traffic areas it is important that the standards and procedures for inland shipping are compatible with already defined standards and procedures for seagoing navigation.

To serve the specific requirements of inland navigation, AIS has been further developed to the so called Inland AIS Standard while preserving full compatibility with IMO’s maritime AIS and already existing standards in inland navigation.

Future developments could lead to alternative vessel tracking and tracing systems, which however have to be compatible with maritime AIS.

In this document chapter 1 describes the functional specifications related to vessel tracking and tracing in inland navigation. In chapter 2, the inland AIS standard is described, including the standard inland tracking and tracing messages. An overview of definitions of services and players is given in ANNEX A: DEFINITIONS.},

   Title = {The Emerging World of Vessel Tracking, ASVTS Update 2005},
   Journal = {Marine Exchange of Alaska},
   Pages = {For ages, the Lure of the Sea, has been the ability to cast off all lines, escape all ties with civilization and sail the oceans blue. Similarly, years ago aviators flew the skies free as a bird. Regrettably, those carefree days are behind us! The high stakes of an aviation or maritime incident and the demand for greater efficiencies in our transportation systems have led to the evolution of tracking technologies which to date, have been slow in coming for the maritime community.

The aviation community has had a comprehensive aircraft tracking and control system in place for years through the use of radars and aircraft transponders. The maritime community is now finally moving in the same direction through the use of new satellite and line of site VHF communication technologies that are providing worldwide vessel tracking.

The one watershed event that accelerated vessel tracking was the 9/11 attack on the U.S. Authorities quickly realized a terrorist incident involving vessels could have even greater impacts and some opined the maritime transportation sector was the least secure and most vulnerable. U.S. Coast Guard Commandant, Admiral Tom Collins highlighted the import of tracking vessels when he stated “with regard to Maritime Domain Awareness, which is the centerpiece of our maritime security strategy, we believe that the installation of Automatic Identification System and Long Range Tracking Devices will aid enormously in providing the necessary information on in-bound maritime shipping, long before ships reach our ports.”

These concerns led to a series of U.S. and international regulations and treaties to bolster security. In 2002, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) passed the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS) requiring a suite of enhanced security measures. These included the installation of worldwide satellite tracking equipment, Ship Security Alert Systems (SSAS) and line of site VHF radio vessel tracking devices, Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) on vessels sailing the oceans to aid the monitoring of vessels’ present positions, past port calls and transits. IMO also passed a resolution which in part stated IMO “Urges Contracting governments to take, as a matter of high priority, any action needed at national level to give effect to implementing and beginning the long-range identification and tracking of ships.” Clearly, the U.S. and the international community are poised to implement systems that track the approximately 60,000 vessels that ply the seas. For the U.S. alone, some 8,000 deep draft vessels call on U.S. ports annually making vessel tracking a daunting challenge!

While vessels have been installing these new communications technologies to provide a worldwide vessel tracking system the equipment and processes required to receive, evaluate and disseminate this surge of information is years off from being fully implemented by governments. The biggest challenges are building and operating the shore based receiving stations around the world to process the vessel information transmitted by vessels’ AIS transponders and determining the systems to be used in collecting and sharing this information.

Recognizing vessel tracking is the wave of the future several commercial and non-governmental entities are developing the systems needed to receive and process vessel position data today. One organization, the non-profit Maritime Information Services of North America comprised of a network of Maritime Exchanges in U.S. and Canada, has developed the capability to bring in both AIS and satellite generated data into a hybrid vessel tracking system called the Automated Secure Vessel Tracking System or ASVTS. MISNA advocates information on vessels’ positions when shared with government and commercial maritime interests can aid “safe, secure, efficient and environmentally sound maritime operations”. In most cases MISNA’s vessel tracking system uses existing on board satellite and VHF communications systems to economically track vessels around the world for a “latte a day”, or $3.00 U.S., a cost every shipper should be able to easily absorb. MISNA has also built a network of AIS receiving stations around the U.S. which report a vessel’s position every minute when in an AIS covered area. When a vessel is outside an AIS area, which is 95% of the time, position reports are provided every few hours by the satellite tracking systems.
	

In the graphic on the right, the CORAL PRINCESS was tracked by AIS in the areas circled in red. In other areas (open ocean) she was tracked with the satellite tracking system.
	Graphic shows combined AIS and Satellite tracking of a vessel in Alaska. The dense report positions are from AIS tracking from the AIS receiver sites in Southeast Alaska indicated by the yellow circles. Where the position reports are less dense in the Gulf of Alaska the ship was being tracked by the satellite tracking portion of the hybrid system. Satellite position reports shown here equate to one per hour. The AIS positions are sensed every minute. Other ships in the satellite tracking system show up as the triangular targets with course vectors. Targets are color coded gray for container or RORO ships, white for passenger ships and black indicates a tanker.

 

To date, participation in the Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) component of MISNA’s secure vessel tracking system is voluntary and is evolving into the “Standard of Care” for responsible ship operators. The owner, operator and affiliates can all view vessels’ positions through use of a user name and password on a secure internet site, information that aids the efficient mobilization of tugs, pilots, shore gangs and agents. Their password determines which vessels they are authorized to see. The Coast Guard has a “master password” and sees all participating vessels. Over time the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection and other agencies will view participating vessels as lower risk vessels and non participants as “high risk” aiding their port clearance and inspection decision process. Vessel charterers will also evaluate a vessel’s participation in a tracking system as part of their vetting process.
	

The graphic on the left illustrates the world wide tracking ability of the system which allows verification of a vessel's itinerary. The graphic on the right shows both AIS and satellite targets, the AIS targets shown in clusters inshore near major ports and the offshore satellite tracked targets showing as single triangles with course vector.

The U.S. Coast Guard Admiral in charge of Alaska operations, Admiral Jim Olson, realized the quickest way to increase his ability to protect vessels sailing his enormous operating area was to ask vessel operators to voluntarily participate in the ASVTS tracking program. As a result, his Operations Center, Captain of the Ports, Coast Guard security vessel patrols and boarding teams all are able to view the locations of all tankers, cruise ships, ferries and many tugs and container ships plying Alaska waters and the Pacific. This information helps the Coast Guard identify anomalies in a vessel’s transit, positively identify prior ports of calls, and respond to emergencies. The tracking system essentially provides a Safety and Security Net for vessels. The owners and operators of the vessels are also realizing benefits in having this information available. The Alaska program may well serve as a model for a “today solution” for implementing a practical, low cost tracking system that aids both government and the marine industry. It is proving to be a “cheaper, better, faster” industry developed solution!

The expression “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade” applies to the onset of the vessel tracking initiatives. If the days of casting off all lines and escaping civilization are over, the challenge is to make vessel tracking a useful, value added tool. Several in the marine industry are doing just that and finding ways to accelerate an industry developed vessel tracking solution that meets the needs of governments while also aiding commercial interests.

   Abstract = {Within the ESA Advanced Research Telecommunications 
program ARTES-5, the project GALEWAT (Galileo and 
EGNOS for Waterway Transport) aims at introducing 
EGNOS into River Information Services (RIS) through 
the Automatic Identification System (AIS), a link that is 
mandatory for seagoing vessels above 300 GT.   
 
The GALEWAT project comprises several phases: 
During the initial definition phase, the system architecture 
and user equipment have been defined in line with 
standards and international recommendations. This phase 
was followed by the implementation phase, aiming at 
developing and setting up the equipment. Finally, the 
project will be completed by an extensive demonstration 
phase, which is currently under execution. Up to now, 
public GALEWAT demonstrations in Vienna (Austria), 
and Lisbon (Portugal) have been successfully executed. 
The last demonstration in Constanta (Romania) will take 
place in fall 2005. These demonstration sites have been 
chosen to test and demonstrate the GALEWAT system in 
different environments: river navigation, harbour approach, and open sea operations.

The paper gives a short idea of River Information 
Services and an overview of the GALEWAT project. The 
main part concentrates on the presentation of field 
measurement results, which were collected in Lisbon, to 
show the performance of the GALEWAT concept. 
Finally, the paper presents an overview of user feedback 
resulting from the first two public demonstrations.},

   Abstract = {This introduces the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and discusses implementation issues. Class A international shipborne device standards are complete, and work continues on Class B and base station standards. This material is current as of June 2002. The paper addresses some Coast Guard specific issues but may interest other members of the Marine Transportation System (MTS) community. 

An Automatic Identification System (AIS) has been under development since 1997 when the International Maritime Organization (IMO) drafted performance recommendations for a worldwide system. The IMO AIS recommendations state that AIS should improve safety “by assisting navigation of ships, protection of the environment, and operation of Vessel Traffic Services (VTS), by satisfying the following functional requirements: in a ship-to-ship mode for 
collision avoidance; as a means for littoral States to obtain information about a ship and its cargo; and as a VTS tool, i.e. ship-to-shore (traffic management).”1 

In 1998, the Coast Guard Research and Development Center (R&DC) began participation “in the international development of AIS technology through the related work of organizations, including the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), International Telecommunications Union (ITU), National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA), etc.,” and began to develop “tools, including a computer simulation, to assess the capability and capacity of a network of AIS devices.”2 Since then, R&DC emphasis has been on direct support for the 
international development and deployment of AIS technology. The R&DC is also active in the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) development of the definition and description of AIS base-stations and infrastructure. IALA has been the primary organization for sponsoring and coordinating AIS development.},
